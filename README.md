# Pokemon Site
A website about Pokémon created for study purposes. The [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) was used to obtain the data. Through the application, it is possible to list all Pokémon and check some useful attributes about them. It also features a page that highlights some legendary Pokémon, as well as a beautiful home page and a 404 page. The app was developed using React and utilizes ContextAPI to manage the application state. SCSS with modules was used for styling, following the mobile-first concept. The layout is responsive and supports devices from 375px to 1920px.

## Installation
To build the application, Node version 18.13.0 was used, along with Yarn as the package manager, and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to create and build the application. To run the application locally in a development environment, simply install the external dependencies and use the command `yarn dev`.

## Usage
The application is hosted on [Netlify](https://pokemon-client-luiz-h.netlify.app/pokedex), where its functionalities can be accessed.
